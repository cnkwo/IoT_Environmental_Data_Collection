# IoT_Environmental_Data_Collection

By Patrick J Nkwocha

The overall idea of this project is to explore the various ways in which sensor networks can be used to 
monitor environmental conditions, and henceforth support precision agriculture practices. The goal of 
the project is to develop a sensor network which monitors environmental parameters such as, 
humidity, barometric pressure, temperature, and windspeed, with the measurements elicited being 
relayed back to the user via the IoT cloud for mobile access, and an LCD screen for indoor access. After 
deriving the sensor readings for each day, the intention is to store key characteristics into a dataset 
and then predict the corresponding readings for the next day, therefore serving as a forecast.

I decided to take an OOP approach for the construction of my code to make it easier to identify object-event relationships.
